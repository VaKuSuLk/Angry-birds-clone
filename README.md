# Angry-birds-clone

"A Clone of Angry Birds Game" involves recreating the popular physics-based puzzle game, where players use a slingshot to launch birds at structures with the goal of destroying all the pigs within. The focus of the project is to replicate the core mechanics, including trajectory calculation, collision detection, and destruction physics. This clone will aims to simulate the engaging gameplay experience of the original, while offering opportunities for customization and enhancement through improved graphics, sound, or unique features.

 It seeks to develop a functional and visually appealing version of the original Angry Birds game. This involves designing an intuitive user interface, developing realistic physics simulations for object movement and collisions, and creating a variety of levels with increasing difficulty. Key aspects include implementing the slingshot mechanic, where players control the angle and force of the bird's launch, and integrating destructible environments, which consist of different materials like wood, glass, and stone that react differently to impacts.

 It also involves optimizing performance for smooth gameplay, adding features such as score tracking, power-ups, and sound effects, and possibly introducing new bird types with unique abilities to make the clone both faithful to the original and innovative.
